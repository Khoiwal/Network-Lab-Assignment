The variable Quantum is the number of bytes that
each queue can transmit in each turn.
1. The Deficit Counter is used to keep track of the
credit (deficit) available to each queue.
2. Each queue is allowed to send a given amount of
bytes (Quantum) in each round of the robin.
3. If the packet size at the front of the queue is larger
than the amount of the Quantum, then the queue
will not be serviced.
The value of the Quantum is added to the Deficit
Counter associated with that queue and will be
used in the next service round.
4. To avoid examining empty queues, the algorithm
keeps an auxiliary list called the Active List, which
is a list of indices of queues that contain at least
one packet.
5. Whenever a packet arrives in an empty queue, the
index of that queue is added to the Active List.
